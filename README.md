## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) by following the official instructions.
   - Rust comes with Cargo, which is the Rust package manager and build tool.
   
   You can verify that Rust and Cargo are installed correctly by running:
   ```bash
   rustc --version
   cargo --version
   ```

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lucky4604/C2Kep.git
```

### Build and Run

Navigate into the project directory and use Cargo to build and run the project:

```bash
cd your-repository-name
cargo build  # Compiles the project
cargo run    # Runs the project

Cargo handles the compilation process and fetches dependencies specified in `Cargo.toml`.

### Dependencies

If the  project depends on any external crates (libraries), they'll be listed in `Cargo.toml`. Cargo will automatically fetch and build these dependencies during the build process.
